<p>Various forms of self-care involve different activities or actions. Each form is as important as the other and drives optimal health and well-being.<br>

<b>Physical Health</b>
<p>
Physical self-care will be different for each person, but ways you can practice physical self-care include:</p>

Getting the proper amount of exercise
Eating regular, well-balanced meals that are mostly whole foods and staying hydrated
Engaging in relaxing activities that can help manage stress
Getting enough sleep
Getting regular medical and dental care
<br>
<b>Mental Health</b>
<p>Mental self-care is designed to drive a healthy mind by practicing brain-stimulating activities and healthy mental behaviors. Mental self-care can help you manage stress, lower your risk of illness, and increase your energy.</p>

While no two people are the same, these strategies can help you manage stress and stimulate your mind:

Use relaxation programs or apps regularly to incorporate meditation, yoga, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. 
Practice gratitude by reminding yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Write them down at night or replay them in your mind.
Participate in creative activities you enjoy.
Read a book or do a puzzle.
Play games such as Scrabble, crossword puzzles, or other brain teasers.
Try a new hobby.
Engage in exercise.
Take adult education classes.
Seek help from a professional as needed.

<b>Relationships</b>
<p>
Having healthy relationships is a form of social self-care all its own. Research has shown that different forms of relationships, whether they be romantic, platonic, or familial, can all benefit overall health and well-being.</p>

On the flip side, not having healthy relationships can be detrimental to health. When people lack platonic relationships, they are more likely to be subject to psychological distress and engage in unhealthy behaviors.

Ways to foster relationships include:

Regularly scheduling get-togethers (coffee, a walk, a meal, going to the movies, or just hanging out) with friends or family members
Connecting with community or faith-based groups
Volunteering for a local organization
Joining a local group, such as a hiking club, knitting group, or other interest group
</p>

<b>Spiritual</b>
<b>Spiritual</b>
<br>
<p>
Not everyone has a spiritual or religious need. However, for some people nurturing their spirit allows them to connect on a deeper level with themselves and to think beyond themselves.</p>

Spiritual self-care practices might include:

Meditating
Hiking or spending time in nature
Listening to inspirational music
Going to church or attending virtual spiritual activities or groups
Praying
Talking with a spiritual advisor
