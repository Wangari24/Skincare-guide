<p id="p1"><b>The World Health Organization</b> defines self-care as: "the ability of individuals, families, and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a health worker." According to this definition, self-care includes everything related to staying physically healthy including hygiene, nutrition, and seeking medical care when needed. It is all the steps an individual can take to manage stressors in his or her life and take care of his or her own health and well-being.</p>

<p id="p2">Self-care requires checking in with yourself and asking yourself how you are doing physically, mentally, and emotionally. Some people use it to deal with difficult news stories, while others practice self-care just to maintain their happiness day to day. Self-care does not mean the same thing for everyone. Different people will adopt different self-care practices, and even your own definition might change over time. "What is self-care for one person will likely differ from someone else, and what is self-care for you one day might not feel like self-care another day," Dr. Amsellem says. Engaging in self-care regularly could help you put your best foot forward. "When we are regularly taking care of ourselves, we are better able to react to the things that go on in our lives," Amsellem says. It is something we do to maintain positive well-being.</p>

<h3>Types of Self-care</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Emotional self-care, such as self-talk, weekly bubble baths, saying        no to things that cause unnecessary stress, giving yourself permission to take a pause, or setting up a weekly coffee date with a friend</li>
    <li>Physical self-care, such as prioritizing sleep, adopting an exercise routine you can stick with, or choosing healthy and nourishing foods over highly processed ones</li>
    <li>Spiritual self-care, such as attending a religious service, spending time in nature, meditating, incorporating regular acts of kindness into your day, or keeping a gratitude journal</li>
